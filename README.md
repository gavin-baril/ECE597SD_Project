# ECE597SD_Project

 Motivation:
    Applications often rely on timing services provided by the OS to perform their intended task. Oftentimes, a applications assume the OS to be trustworthy and secure. However, an adversary can manipulate the system's time services, defying the expected performance. A malicious OS can attack an application using CPU frequency manipulation and evicting memory pages used by the time keeping application, reulting in errors in scheduling and causality. In an OS, existing time services can be subject to manipulation. 
    
Goal:
  To use device microarchitecture such as processor access to cache/memory to build a secure timing service
